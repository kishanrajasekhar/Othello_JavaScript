# Othello_JavaScript

I am re making the othello game I created in python, except this time using html and javascript (with some jquery).
The javascript takes careof the logic, while the html serves as the gui.
I also used bootstrap, which aligns the options and the game board in one column if the screen size is too small.

I created this program so I could practice web development with javascript.
